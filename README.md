# SMS-SPAM-CLASSIFICATION
This Python project is focused on classifying SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam) using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing the SMS data to clean and transform it into a suitable format for analysis. Several popular machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression are employed for classification. The project evaluates the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision,etc. Additionally, the best-performing model is deployed for real-time classification of incoming SMS messages.
